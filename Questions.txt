Questions:


1. Should the indentation be configurable? If yes how do you set it?
Comments: I have injected it as a dependency so if it can be injected from a web config file if you want to implement the utility as a service.

2. What is the purpose of having SingleChildNode & TwoChildrenNode? The firstChild, secondChild in TwoChildrenNode is not nice if the pattern goes on.

3. Error logging and invalid input can be implemented depending on the requirement.
